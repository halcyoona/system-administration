Now we consider a usecase of apache web server that we are deploying on a machine.
The first thing you have to do is to install apache by typing this command.
sudo apt install apache2
 and then install monit by typing this command.
 sudo apt install monit
 After installation you fill find a file with this name monitrc configuration file
 open this file 
 sudo vi /etc/monit/monitrc
 Then configure your setting according to apache web server.
comment out the following lines. And replace the localhost by your private IP in use address line 

# check services every 2 minutes
set daemon 120

# logging 
set logfile /var/log/monit.log

# web interface
set httpd port 2812 and
    use address localhost # only accept connection from localhost
    allow localhost       # allow localhost to connect to the server    
    allow admin:monit     # require user ‘admin’ with password ‘monit’
    allow 0.0.0.0/0

# monitor apache
check process apache2 with pidfile /var/run/apache2/apache2.pid
    start program = "/etc/init.d/apache2 start"
    if totalmem > 25.0 MB for 2 cycles then alert

 After this you will start the apache service
 sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start 

 and then you can check apache.pid file exist at that location
 cat var/run/apache2/apache2.pid

 then for checking syntax of configuration file i.e monitrc
 sudo monit -t

 and then Enable the services 
 sudo vi /etc/default/monit

 change the following line 
 startup=1

 and the start the monit 
 sudo /etc/init.d/monit start

 And Now you can open a browser on your local machine and type this public IP of instance and port.
 publicIP:2812

 This screen comes up 

 Enter your username and password that you have set in config file 
 username admin
 password monit

 And then you will login in your monit. you will see all your process running and click on a process and you will able to check the status of the process.
